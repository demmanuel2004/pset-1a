<h2>Polar Bear Habitats</h2>
<div class="content">
	<p class="fifth">Polar bears live in the circumpolar north. Polar bears are solitary and overwhelmingly carnivorous, feeding especially on the ringed seal but also on the bearded seal and other pinnipeds. The bear stalks seals resting on the ice, ambushes them near breathing holes, and digs young seals from snow shelters where they are born. Polar bears prefer ice that is subject to periodic fracturing by wind and sea currents, because these fractures offer seals access to both air and water. As their prey is aquatic, polar bears are excellent swimmers, and they are even known to kill beluga whales. In swimming the polar bear uses only its front limbs, an aquatic adaptation found in no other four-legged mammal. Polar bears see oppurtunity as well as they are predatory; they will consume dead fish and carcasses of stranded whales and eat garbage near human settlements.</p>
