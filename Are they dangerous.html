<h2>Are They Dangerous</h2>
<div class="content">
	<p class="second"> Polar bears are carnivores in the north land, and because their icy habitat has little vegetation to offer them, they’re the most carnivorous of all bear species. They have huge bellies to fill and take advantage of food as it presents itself. They’re also dangerous because they’re skilled apex predators: they can easily outrun a human, and knock its head off with a swing of its pawed fist. Which means, cute as it may be, the polar bear is pretty much the great white shark of the artic. It is adapted well to do its job, of eating animals. Mainly, they eat seals that poke their heads out of water for air, but they’ll eat anything else they stumble across too, like birds, beluga WHALES, walruses, musk oxen and sometimes even a person. </p>
